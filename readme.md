# Mail in blockchain (Centralised for Enterprise)

# Problem statement

1. The number of monthly phishing attacks has doubled in two years, from about 40,000 in May 2020 to **more than 100,000 in April 2022**
    - Phishers deliberately registered 69% of all domains—and 92% of new gTLD(generic Domain .xyz,.loan) domains on which phishing occurred.

2. The most recent projections performed by the  Ponemon Institute reports
the average loss by companies to phishing in 2021 is $14.8 million, more than triple what it was in 2015. **That translates to hundreds of billions of dollars in total losses from phishing attacks to global businesses.**

3. With Blockchain, emails probably wouldn’t move between email servers. Instead, they would be fetched from someplace in the blockchain and rendered to the recipient upon request.
